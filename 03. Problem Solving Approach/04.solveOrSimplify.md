Solving Problems: Simplify or Solve
===================================

This video discusses the importance of simplifying complex problems or solving simpler versions of them to make progress in problem-solving, especially in coding interviews.

Components of Problem Solving
-----------------------------

1.  **Understand the Problem:** Gain clarity on the problem statement and requirements.
2.  **Explore Concrete Examples:** Analyze edge cases, inputs, and outputs.
3.  **Break Down the Approach:** Outline steps to approach the problem solution.
4.  **Solve or Simplify:** Attempt to solve the problem or simplify it to make progress.
5.  **Implement and Refine:** Write code based on the outlined approach and refine as needed.

Solve or Simplify
-----------------

When faced with a challenging problem:

*   Attempt to solve it directly if possible.
*   If unable to solve, simplify the problem by ignoring the most challenging aspects temporarily.
*   Focusing on what can be solved helps in making progress.
*   Simplifying a problem often leads to gaining insights into the solution.

Example: Writing a Character Count Function
-------------------------------------------

Consider the problem of writing a function to count each character in a given string.

*   Identify potential difficulties such as looping or manipulating objects.
*   Start with the aspects you're comfortable with, such as basic looping.
*   Ignore complexities like checking for alphanumeric characters initially.
*   Once progress is made, focus on incorporating the challenging aspects.

Conclusion
----------

Solving problems in coding interviews involves a combination of direct problem-solving and simplification strategies. Prioritizing progress and demonstrating problem-solving skills are key in such scenarios.
