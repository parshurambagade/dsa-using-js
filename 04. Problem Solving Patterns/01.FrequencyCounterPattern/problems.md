# Frequency Counter Pattern Problems:

1. **Two Sum**
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Problem: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

2. **Valid Anagram**
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Problem: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and false otherwise.

3. **Find All Anagrams in a String**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Problem: Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`.

4. **Same Frequency**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Problem: Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

5. **Valid Palindrome**
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Problem: Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

6. **Frequency Sort**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Problem: Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

7. **Word Pattern**
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Problem: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.

8. **First Unique Character in a String**
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Problem: Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

9. **Group Anagrams**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Problem: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

10. **Subarray Sum Equals K**
    - Difficulty: Medium
    - Problem: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.

These problems cover a range of difficulty levels and scenarios where the frequency counter pattern can be effectively applied to solve them.
